# PHP-User-Authentication-Page

This project is a basic user authentication system built with PHP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and MySQL. It includes functionalities for user sign-up, sign-in, and session management, allowing users to register, log in, and access a protected index page. The project includes two core components:

Sign In: Validates user credentials and initiates a session upon successful authentication.

Sign Up: Registers new users into the system with secure password hashing.

I used XAMPP for testing the code since it includes phpMyAdmin, which allowed me to create the database and connect it to my code through the config file.

# Project Features:
User Registration: Allows users to create an account with their email, first name, last name, password.

User Login: Authenticates users based on email and password, with password hashing using PHP's password_hash and password_verify functions.

Session Management: Maintains user sessions, ensuring secure access to protected pages.

Logout: Allows users to securely log out and destroy their session.

# Prerequisites:
